## Testing Framework

### Automated Testing Setup
```javascript
// Face detection accuracy test suite
const testCases = [
  {
    imageUrl: 'test-images/oval-face-1.jpg',
    expectedShape: 'oval',
    expectedConfidence: 0.8,
    demographics: { age: 25, gender: 'female', ethnicity: 'caucasian' }
  },
  // ... more test cases
];

async function runAccuracyTests() {
  const results = [];
  
  for (const testCase of testCases) {
    try {
      const result = await faceDetectionService.analyzeFromUrl(testCase.imageUrl);
      
      results.push({
        testCase,
        result,
        correct: result.faceShape.name === testCase.expectedShape,
        confidence: result.confidence,
        processingTime: result.processingTime
      });
    } catch (error) {
      results.push({
        testCase,
        error: error.message,
        correct: false

  const correct = results.filter(r => r.correct).length;
  const errors = results.filter(r => r.error).length;
  
  const accuracy = (correct / total) * 100;
  const errorRate = (errors / total) * 100;
  const avgConfidence = results
    .filter(r => r.result)
    .reduce((sum, r) => sum + r.confidence, 0) / (total - errors);
  
  return {
    totalTests: total,
    correctPredictions: correct,
    accuracy: accuracy.toFixed(2),
    errorRate: errorRate.toFixed(2),
    averageConfidence: avgConfidence.toFixed(2),
    averageProcessingTime: calculateAvgProcessingTime(results)
  };
}
```
